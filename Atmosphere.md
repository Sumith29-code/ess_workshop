## Chapter 5: Techniques for Measuring Atmospheric Properties
Techniques for measuring atmospheric properties involve a combination of ground-based, airborne, and satellite methods to monitor conditions such as temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and air composition. Ground-based instruments like thermometers, barometers, and hygrometers provide direct measurements, while radiosondes attached to weather balloons collect vertical profiles of the atmosphere. Remote sensing technologies, including radar and lidar, are used to study cloud structures, aerosols, and wind patterns. Satellites equipped with sensors measure large-scale atmospheric parameters, such as greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature distribution, offering a global perspective. Together, these techniques provide critical data for weather forecasting, climate studies, and environmental monitoring.
