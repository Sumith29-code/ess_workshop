## Chapter 4: The Mesosphere, Thermosphere, and Exosphere

### Structure and Extent of Each Layer
The mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere are the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere, each with distinct characteristics. The mesosphere extends from about 50 to 85 km above Earth, where temperatures decrease with altitude, making it the coldest layer and the region where meteors burn up. Above it, the thermosphere stretches from 85 to around 600 km, with temperatures rising sharply due to solar radiation; this layer contains the ionosphere, responsible for auroras and radio signal transmission, and is where the International Space Station orbits. The outermost layer, the exosphere, begins around 600 km and gradually fades into space, with extremely thin air composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, allowing satellite orbits and minimal particle collisions.
