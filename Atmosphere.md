  - A defining characteristic of the troposphere is the general decrease in temperature with an increase in altitude. This is because the primary source of heat for this layer is the Earth's surface, which absorbs solar radiation and then warms the air above it. As you move higher, the air becomes less dense and the heating effect of the surface diminishes. On average, the temperature drops by about 6.5 degrees Celsius for every 1-kilometer increase in altitude (or about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit per 1,000 feet). This rate of temperature change is known as the environmental lapse rate.

  - The stratosphere is the second major layer of Earth's atmosphere, situated between the troposphere below and the mesosphere above. It extends from an average altitude of about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) to approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) above the Earth's surface. The name "stratosphere" is derived from the Latin word "stratus," which means "spreading out," referring to the stratified or layered nature of this atmospheric level where temperature increases with altitude.

  - Beginning with the layer immediately above the stratosphere, here's a look at the upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere: the mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.

The Mesosphere: The Meteor Shield ☄️

The mesosphere lies directly above the stratosphere and extends from about 50 to 85 kilometers (31 to 53 miles) above the Earth. The name is derived from the Greek word "mesos," meaning middle.

Key Characteristics:

    Temperature: In this layer, the temperature once again decreases with increasing altitude. It is home to the coldest temperatures in the Earth's atmosphere, plunging to as low as -90°C (-130°F) at its upper boundary, the mesopause.

Meteor Protection: The mesosphere is the layer where most meteors burn up upon entering the atmosphere. The friction between the meteoroids and the gas molecules in this layer creates intense heat, causing them to vaporize and creating the spectacle of "shooting stars."

Noctilucent Clouds: This layer is also where the rare and beautiful noctilucent, or "night-shining," clouds can be seen. These wispy clouds are composed of ice crystals and are only visible from higher latitudes during twilight when the sun has set below the horizon but is still illuminating these high-altitude clouds
